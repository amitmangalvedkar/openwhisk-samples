## Using OpenWhisk to process unstructured data for the Watson IoT Platform ##
* OpenWhisk application showing how you can use OpenWhisk to process unstructured data (image) for Watson IoT Platform
* Application takes images from Cameras (via a Cloudant NoSQL database)
* Application performs visual recognition and generates metadata for these images
* Analyzed image metadata is sent to Watson IoT Platform
* WIoTP now has capability to understand the above analyzed data along with information of the device which has sent it

**In case you want to directly jump to installation, go to the [Installation and Uninstallation steps](/documentation/deployment.md)**
