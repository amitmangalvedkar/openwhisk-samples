## Watson IoT Platform understands structured data ##  
* Input data to Watson IoT Platform is in the form of structured data, typically JSON data
* WIoTP can make use of RTI (apart from other services) for taking further action on the data â€“ which could be sending an email notification, or making a ReST call  


## Unstructured data ##   
* The Watson IoT Platform service does not provide built-in functionality to process or manipulate unstructured data such as an image or video,
* In addition, image or video files typically contain more than 128kB of data, which is beyond the maximum permissible size for messages in WIoTP
* This solution illustrates a pattern in which the image data is processed first using OpenWhisk and structured metadata describing the image is then passed to WIoTP in the form of an event.
